## Theory

In this lesson, we're diving deeper in the world of Web APIs. We'll explore how the DOM works and gain a deeper understanding of how we can use JavaScript to interact with it. Using Web APIs, we research several methods of enhancing the user experience. We investigate options, note restrictions and document findings.

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 2:20h
*  **Goals**: Events and the DOM
*  **Period**: Week 2

#### In-class exercises

* Conduct research regarding Progressive Enhancement. How does it work? What examples can you find?
* Conduct research regarding Web APIs. How do they work? What do they do? Document these findings.
* Conduct research regarding Events. What events are there? How do they work?
* Experiment with events. Implement an event listener you haven't heard of and/or used before in the Codepen.

#### Homework

Continue working on your functionality, start building the HTML according to the principles you've learned in FED1 and Internetstandaarden
