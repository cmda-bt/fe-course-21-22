## Theory

In this lesson, we're diving deeper in the world of Web APIs. We'll explore how the DOM works and gain a deeper understanding of how we can use JavaScript to interact with it. Using Web APIs, we research several methods of enhancing the user experience. We investigate options, note restrictions and document findings.

## Assignments

### DOM Manipulation

![DOM Manipulation banner](assets/banners/dom.jpg)
> Understand how the DOM (document object model) works and try out different events

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 8:00h
*  **Goals**: subgoal 3, subgoal 4
*  **Period**: before week 3

#### In-class exercises

Finish the in-class exercises about DOM manipulation and events. Experiment and try out a couple of different events you can listen for.

#### Assignment
Add any design patterns that need JavaScript interaction (events and DOM) in the interface of your features (dropdowns, filters, menu's etc.). Additionally continue working on your front-end of your feature, start building the HTML and CSS according to the principles you've learned in FED1 and Internetstandaarden. 

### API's
![Basics Banner](assets/banners/api.jpg)
> Research client-side web API's and third party data API's that can be used for your progressive enhancement

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 8:00h
*  **Goals**: subgoal 4, subgoal 5
*  **Period**: before week 3

#### Assignment

Research different native web api's and figure out which API you can use for your progressive enhancement. Additionally research a third party (data api) that has data you can use for your enhancement. Document what API's you've researched, why you choose a particular API and how the implementation works in your wiki. If you decided, you can already start with implementing and writing code for the usage of that API.
