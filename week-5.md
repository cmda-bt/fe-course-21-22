## Assignments

> _This week your **individual assessment (A1)** will take place. There is no new theory. You can continue working on your progressive enhancement_.

**A1 rubric:**  
This is the rubric your teacher will grade you on during the assessment. Ask yourself upon completion if everything listed on the rubric is clear and that you understand each row and column, if not ask your teacher on MS Teams!

→ [Rubric](/grading/a1.md)

**Questions:**  

If you have any question you can reach the student-assistants and teachers on MS Teams. Make sure you are prepared:

* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem and try to fix it together.
* Know which questions you want to ask and formulate it clearly.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.

## Assessment

Based on your repository, source code and documentation in the wiki you show what feature you've created for front-end. _A teacher will try out your feature and look at the code._ You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. We'll be using your codebase as the main entry for your submission, so please make sure to use *code comments* as a way to *describe what you do and why you do so*. Use the wiki to *document sources and reflect on your performance*.
