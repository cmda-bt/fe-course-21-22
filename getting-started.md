## Description

👋 **Welcome to front-end!** 

This getting started guide will get you up and running with all the software and tools you need for this course. Throughout this guide there are additional video's that further explain important topics from lectures but also show you how to install certain technology. Look for a 🎦 emoji!

## Prerequisite

This guide assumes you already followed the getting started guide from project-tech and Back-end. So you should already have a Text Editor, GitHub account and configured Git.

Furthermore, for the first lesson, please read the following articles:

* [W3Schools. (2022). JavaScript Data Types.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
* [Hayani, S. (2020, 24 april). JavaScript ES6 — write less, do more. freeCodeCamp.Org.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/write-less-do-more-with-javascript-es6-5fd4a8e50ee2/)

## Text Editor

For this course you won't need anything other then a Code Editor and a Web Browser. It doesn't really matter which one you pick, as long as you feel comfortable using it. However, we do recommend moving away from [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), other editors offer better customizability. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our recommended choice but there are others.  [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) are both also good choices.

> Take some time to [learn the interface and features of VSCode][learnvs]. If you know your way around the interface, coding will be easier. Feeling comfortable with your tools is very important when writing code.

## Web Browser

For your Browser basically anything goes as long as you are comfortable with the Developer Tools. Chrome and Firefox are both good choices. Safari will work but the Developer Tools of that browser lack some features as opposed to Chromium based ones.

> Take some time to [learn the developer tools][learndevtools] of your specific browser. If you know your way around the interface, coding will be easier. Feeling comfortable with your tools is very important when writing code.

## Communication

### Brightspace

We use our DLO Brightspace for schedulers and rubric feedback. Make sure you enroll to the **Front-end** course, you can do so by using the [HvA courseselector][course]. It's important to **select the right class** for teachers to give you feedback and grades. Go to Administration > Groups and pick the right class. If you're not sure, ask your teacher to see if you are on the correct _classlist_.

### Microsoft Teams

Sign up for our _Blok-Tech_ MS Team. **You can find the sign-up code in the announcement on Brightspace.** Join the `#front-end` channel in our team. Get your account set up properly, add your  **real name**, **a profile picture**, and you can even set your **GitHub username** as a status message. We’ll use this info to link your GitHub and MS Teams account to our administration files.

### GitHub

GitHub is a social platform so give this repository `fe-course-21-22` [a ⭐ star][star] and start [following][follow] your teachers and fellow students!


**Wow, you did it! Virtual high five! 🖐** During this course we'll use GitHub issues and templates. Each assignment has a different template in which you can hand in your assignments for that week. This is also the place where teachers and student-assistants will give you feedback. You can use [GitHub notifications][notifications] (bell on the top right of the GitHub website) to keep track of those changes.

> 🚨 Make sure you never publicly share you name and student number in combination! If you fill in your class you can **use your tech group** `tech-x` not your 'regular' `20x` group.

/Happy Coding!
