## Assignments

The upcoming weeks you'll work with your team to create a complete matching application. So most of the time of front-end is spend building out your application, adding features and building the front-end. Additionaly you'll work on (atleast one) front-end production optimization.

> We expect you to atleast pick **one subject** and do a deep dive but you can do more which will usually result in a higher grade. It's important that you really do a deep-dive into the topic. So extensive research documented in the wiki and advanced implementation.

### Topic

*   **Goals**: subgoal 6,7
*   **Due**: before week 8

#### Description
In the weeks of the team assignment you'll work on optimizing (the front-end interface or dev tooling) of the team project. You can decide which subject interests you and what you'll want to work on. The subject can be anything related to front-end. We discussed a couple of relevant subject in class like: performance optimization (compressing images, lazy loading images, font optimization) but subjects can also be developer tooling related (preprocessors, like sass or postcss to structure css, minify client-side javascript code). If you're not sure, discuss with your fellow students and teacher what to work on.
