# Statement on Course Material

Our curriculum and course material are publicly available on the Block Tech (github.com/cmda-bt) GitHub organization. We follow the global trend to make teaching materials accessible to everyone inspired by the [Open Education Global][oec].

You can view content, such as readers, notes and book lists but also look at student examples after the course is finished. Feel free to browse around! If you are not a student at the AUAS or aren't enrolled in this specific course on Brightspace, it is not possible to ask questions to teachers.

We keep students personal information, grade lists, assessment results and communication [private](/docs/privacy.md).
