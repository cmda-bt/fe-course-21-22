## Digital Accessibility

Most of our course material is accessible by default. We check our course material to see if it passes [level AA of the web guidelines][wcag]. 

* We offer **large print versions** of rubrics and important grading documents, you can also change the browser zoom level to increase font-sizes on GitHub
* Most of the resources we use in class are web-based and thus can be **used with a screen reader**, we write in markdown so text gets converted to semantic HTML
* We offer **multiple media types** of the same resources such as video's or audio material so text isn't the main type of content
