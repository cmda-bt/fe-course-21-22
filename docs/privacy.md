## Confidentiality

An important part of the experience of becoming a web developer is to exit the walled garden that is formal education.
To participate, collaborate, and join the conversation happening around you on the internet. Which is what we’ll do in this course.

Students are sometimes reluctant to share work online as they are afraid of negative feedback.
Typically though, poor quality work is ignored rather than ridiculed (in fact, most work is ignored).
Good work in a course like this is instead used by students to land job offers in the future.
And the experience of collaborating online often provides a positive transformative experience.

If you are afraid of stalkers, don’t want your family finding out what you work on, or for other reasons want to stay anonymous in the online parts of our course, you may use an anonymous username, email address, and avatar.

## GitHub profile
Teachers will appreciate it if you upload a representing profile and pick a username that closely resembles your real name.  You’re allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive information, but a good looking GitHub profile can help you get an internship or job later.
