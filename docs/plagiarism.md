# Statement of Academic Integrity

> Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. We report it to our assessment committee
([examencommissie](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=1738) in Dutch). 

## Plagiarism
See ¶ 6.1.2 of Teaching and Examination
Regulations (TER) 2017-2018 (in Dutch: Onderwijs- en examenregeling, OER) for
a full definition, but here are a few cases that count as plagiarism:

> a. using or copying someone else’s texts, data or ideas without a full and
> correct acknowledgement of sources;
> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as
> your own work or ideas, even when a reference to other authors has been
> included;
>
> \[…]
>
> e. copying (parts of) media files or other sources, software source codes,
> models and other diagrams of other people without acknowledgement and
> allowing it to be held as your own work;
>
> \[…]
>
> g. copying the work of fellow-students and allowing it to be held as your
> own work;
>
> \[…]

You are not allowed to simply use portions of someone else's work in your project. The copyright is owned by the creator of the work. You must cite the sources used. Quoting or using material without a source citation is plagiarism and is punishable. More information on the [Student Copyright Information Point](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/library/support/search/acknowledging-sources/acknowledging-sources.html). Make sure you cite your sources in the repository, code comments or documentation of your project on GitHub.

## Open source software

We strongly urge you to use free and open source software in the form of libraries and require you to use Node. If you find a project on GitHub (or similar platforms), that doesn’t mean that you are allowed to use it. Projects must have a license that explicitly lets you use it. Acknowledge the authors of these works by citing their name and linking to their projects.

* **Check the license:** pay attention to the license under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and requirements of those licenses. choosealicense.com explains common software licenses and their permissions.
* **Use of libraries (packages):** The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

## Help

In this course, we require you to collaborate with team members. In this course, we strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help). Please refrain from doing their work for them. You can often tell when you cross that line. Don’t cross it. And always acknowledge when someone helped you.
