## Theory

In this lesson, we're going to explore the several "good practices" within JavaScript, or programming general. We'll read about good defaults, naming and coding styles. In addition, we'll dive deeper in some more complex concepts within JavaScript. We'll handle scope, context, hoisting and closures. All of these are more universal than just JavaScript, and are applicable in several other languages if you wish to study more.
