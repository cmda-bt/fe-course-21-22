## Theory

In this lesson, we're going to explore the several "good practices" within JavaScript, or programming general. We'll read about good defaults, naming and coding styles. In addition, we'll look at higher order functions to loop and iterate over datasets.

## Assignments

### Transform

![Transform banner](assets/banners/transform.jpg)
> Learn more about looping, iterating and higher-order function for datasets

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 6:00h
*  **Goals**: subgoal 1, 5
*  **Period**: Before week-5

#### Assignments

Finish the in-class exercises about higher-order functions and the array cardio. Apply the concepts and principles on your own enhancement, you might want to transform the dataset you got from last week to filter / iterate over the data you will use in your application.

### Principles

![Principles banner](assets/banners/principles.jpg)
> Learn more about some advanced JavaScript coding principles and concepts

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 6:00h
*  **Goals**: subgoal 1 
*  **Period**: Before week-5

#### Assignments

Conduct research regarding your own use of coding principles. What principles do you use already? Which ones would you like to implement in your own projects? Learn more about JavaScript concepts as scope, context, hoisting and closures. These should help you to write "better" code and evade errors.

Additionally continue working on your front-end and progressive enhancement. Also finish your wiki and research to PE and JavaScript concept. Next week A1 will take place.
