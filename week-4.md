## Theory

* We'll learn more about how callbacks work in functions, and how we can use parameters to pass on informations in seperate functions. This is also called higher order functions (HOF).
* We'll learn how promises work, and how we can fetch() a URL to retrieve data from an endpoint.
* We dive deeper in the syntax of Async/Await, and learn how this is basically _syntactic sugar_ on top of how regular promises work
* We'll dive into the requirements and deliverables of the A1 assessment next week

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 2:20h
*  **Goals**: Callbacks & Async
*  **Period**: Week 3

#### In-class exercises

* Fetch information and retrieve a subset of the data.
* Continue working on your feature

#### Assignments

**Work for week 5:**

* Work on your feature. A1 is right around the corner. Your deadline for the A1 assessment is Friday the 18th of March on 17:00. (However, that deadline isn't restricted to 17:00, we just hope you start your weekend on time...)
