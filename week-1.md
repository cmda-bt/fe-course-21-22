## Theory
Before you start you'll probably want to refresh your JavaScript knowledge a bit. In the first week we'll talk about ES5 vs ES6, basic data types and progressive enhancement. We'll cover this in the lab but make sure you fully understand these concept, the resources below can help.

* [_The Complete ECMAScript guide_][ecma-guide]
* [_You Don't Know JS: What is JavaScript_][what-js]

## Assignments

### Basics

> Refresh basic JavaScript knowledge and learn about the difference between ES5 and ES6

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 2:20h
*  **Goals**: ES6 and Datatypes
*  **Period**: Week 1

Read some of the more in-depth JavaScript articles below:

*  [Var Let and Const by Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjyJBL5fkp8)
* [Values, Types and Operators chapter from Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)

Then, finish the assignments that are used in the Lab of this week. 

* Front-end (blok web) JavaScript refactor to ES6
* [Datatypes cardio on CodePen](https://codepen.io/robertspier/pen/KKyNQGM)

Additionally you can refresh more of your JavaScript knowledge by doing a couple of FreeCodeCamp exercises or do some exercises from Wes Bos his JavaScript30 course. 

* [FreeCodeCamp Basics JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com)


### Enhancement

![Enhancement banner](assets/banners/enhancement.png)
> Research progressive enhancement and document in your wiki your idea of the progressively enhanced component you want to build during this project.

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 6:00h
*  **Goals**: subgoal 1, subgoal 2
*  **Due**: before week 2

#### Assignment
Research progressive enhancement and document your idea of the component you want to build during this project.

* Look for inspiration, what components do you see in the wild and will fit your matching application?
* What will be done server-side, what will be done client-side?
* Are you going to use web API's on the client to enhance the user experience?
* What will happen if JavaScript is disabled? Will it degrade gracefully to HTML & CSS?

**Read for week 2:**
* [MDN. (2021, 14 september). Introduction to the DOM - Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
* [MDN. (2022, 4 februari). Introduction to events - Learn web development ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

**Additional resources**
* [The Power of Progressive Enhancement by Andy Bell](https://archive.hankchizljaw.com/wrote/the-power-of-progressive-enhancement/)
* [Progressive Enhancement Reading list by Quirksblog](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2021/02/progressive_enh_1.html)
