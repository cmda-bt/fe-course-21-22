## Description
In Front-end 2 we concentrate on improving the knowledge core JavaScript concepts and learn how to progressively enhance interfaces with mostly JavaScript. Multiple frontend components are designed and build using client-side JavaScript.

Front-end 2 is an elective course given in Quarter 3 (spring) after the core curriculum of our programme, building further on knowledge acquired in *Internetstandaarden*, *Inleiding Programmeren*, and *Blok Web*. This course is chosen alongside **Back-end** and **Project Tech**, together making up Block Tech.

If you’d like to continue with web development after this course, do a tech internship, choose the [Tech Track][track] for the fall semester next year, and pick [Minor Everything Web][minor] in the spring semester after that. Just a quick check if anyone actually reads this: if you see this, please send your teacher a picture of your favorite animal.

_Front-end 2 is part of the  CMD Amsterdam **design & build space** (technical course) that focusses on   Conceptualizing (2), Imagining and creating (3), Multidisciplinary collaboration (5) & Research (9) competences._
