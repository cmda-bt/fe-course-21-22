## Theory

In this lesson, we're going to explore the several "good practices" within JavaScript, or programming general. We'll read about good defaults, naming and coding styles. In addition, we'll dive deeper in some more complex concepts within JavaScript. We'll handle scope, context, hoisting and closures. All of these are more universal than just JavaScript, and are applicable in several other languages if you wish to study more. Finally, we'll work on implementing the principle of Progressive Enhancement in a form on codepen.

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 2:20h
*  **Goals**: Coding principles & concepts
*  **Period**: Week 3

#### In-class exercises

* Conduct research regarding your own use of coding principles. What principles do you use already? Which ones would you like to implement in your own projects?
* Learn more about JavaScript concepts as scope, context, hoisting and closures. These should help you to write "better" code and evade errors.
* Apply three layers of Progressive Enhancement on a [blank form in codepen][codepen]. Apply HTML properties, CSS pseudo selectors and your new knowledge of events to improve the user experience.

#### Homework

Continue working on your functionality. Start updating your wiki on the type of Progressive Enhancement you wish to apply. Next week, we'll be checking up on those wiki's. Also try and implement the first layers (HTML and CSS) this week.
