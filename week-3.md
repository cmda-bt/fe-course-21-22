## Theory

In this lesson, we're going to explore the difference between sync and async. We'll learn how promises work, and how we can fetch() a URL to retrieve data from an endpoint. We dive deeper in the syntax of Async/Await, and learn how this is basically syntactic sugar on top of how regular promises work.

## Assignments

### Sync vs Async

> Understand how sync versus async programming works

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 4:00h
*  **Goals**: Subgoal 5
*  **Period**: Before week 4

#### In-class exercises

Finish the in-class exercises about sync versus async and understand how promises and async programming work.

### Fetch

![fetch banner](assets/banners/fetch.jpg)
> Understand how API's work and how to fetch data using async programming

#### Synopsis

*  **Time**: 6:00h
*  **Goals**: Subgoal 5
*  **Period**: Before week 4

#### In-class exercises

Finish the in-class exercises about API's. Research third-party (data) API's that you can use in your project and see what authentication they use.

#### Assignment

Implement the API you've researched. Use async programming to fetch data from the API client-side to enhance data in your interface and application. You can also continue working on any part of your progressive enhancement.
