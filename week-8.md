> _This week your **team assessment (A2)** will take place. There is no new theory. You can continue working on your matching application._.

## Assessment

Based on your repository, source code and live version you show what you contributed to the team project for front-end. You'll present your application as a team and **a teacher will look through your front-end code and ask questions**. By answering questions you demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals. _This is an individual test, so they will be conducted between one teacher and one student._
