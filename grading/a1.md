# ![Frontend - A1][banner]

## Assessment A1 - Individual

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product. You've applied the technical concepts covered in the class and build a *progressively enhanced* feature and front-end of your matching application feature. You've done research on what progressive enhancement means and documented your findings. You've also written about your research about JavaScript concept and API's.

_A teacher will try out your feature and look at the code._ You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. We'll be using your codebase as the main entry for your submission, so please make sure to use *code comments* as a way to *describe what you do and why you do so*. Use the wiki to *document sources and reflect on your performance*.

## Hand-in

**You hand-in your code on the A1 assignment slot on Brightspace.** Your teacher will look at the codebase in your repository and read your research in the wiki. The rubric will be filled in and communicated trough Brightspace. The rubric contains your grade for this assessment.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the assessment is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the assessment. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

> _You'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_ you can't compensate between rows.  
> _Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.
