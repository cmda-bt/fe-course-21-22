## Grading

| Task                                |   Weight |
| ----------------------------------  | -------: |
| [Assessment 1][a1] (individual)        |      50% |
| [Assessment 2][a2] (team)            |      50% |
| **Total**                           | **100%** |


```js
if (!a1 && !a2) {
  grade = 'GR'
} else if (a1 < 5.5 || a2 < 5.5) {
  grade = 1
} else {
  grade = (a1 * 0.5) + (a2 * 0.5)
}
```

> You can find your feedback and final calculated grade in Brightspace under `administration > grades`.

## Goals

The main goals in this course:

* You improve your knowledge about core (ES6+) JavaScript concepts
* You know what progressive enhancement means (and understand how fallbacks work)
* You can build an enhanced frontend component with client-side JavaScript
* You understand how events work and can manipulate the DOM
* You understand the use of API's and can implement a web and third-party API's
* You can optimize a front-end application for production use
* You are able to read documentation and research technical topics

## Assessments

### A1 - Feature (Individual)
This is an *oral test* where you individually present the **progressive enhancement you created** for Front-end. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

→ [Rubric of assessment 1][a1]

### A2 - Application (Team)
This is an *oral test* where you **work on the production environment of your team application**. You will show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project.

→ [Rubric of assessment 2][a2]

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. We report it to our assessment committee
([examencommissie](https://dlo.mijnhva.nl/d2l/le/lessons/124294/lessons/302524) in Dutch). For more on plagiarism read our [_statement of academic integrity_](https://github.com/cmda-bt/fe-course-21-22/blob/main/docs/plagiarism.md).


## Publishing
Grades will be published and communicated in _Brightspace_ and/or _MS Teams_. We also publish grade lists on _Brightspace_ based on student numbers.

* Final grades will be **published** ~_one week_ after test date.
* Final grades will be put in **SIS** ~_two weeks_ after test date.

> After the first oral test you can request **viewing time** for additional feedback, this can be useful for a resit. Feel free to [contact your lecturer trough _MS Teams_](/readme#synopsis) if you want to do so.
