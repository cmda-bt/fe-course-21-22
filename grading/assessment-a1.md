## Description

Assessment 1 tests your knowledge of in this course acquired matter.

You'll be creating a *progressively enhanced* feature in your functionality. You're applying the concept to the functionality you've been building with the other courses. You've done research on how to accomplish the PE, documented your findings, implemented them in your code, and wrote a small reflection on the subject.
