## Synopsis

* **Weight**: 50%
* **Type**: Digital assessment
* **Date**: week of 14-18 March
## Description

Assessment 1 tests your knowledge of in this course acquired matter.

You'll be creating a *progressively enhanced* feature in your functionality. You're applying the concept to the functionality you've been building with the other courses. You've done research on how to accomplish the PE, documented your findings, implemented them in your code, and wrote a small reflection on the subject.
We'll be using your codebase as the main entry for your submission, so please make sure to use *code comments* as a way to *describe what you do and why you do so*. Use the wiki to *document sources and reflect on your performance*.
You will be asked to explain the learned coding principles and progressive enhancement in the oral test ([FE Assessment 2](https://github.com/cmda-bt/fe-course-19-20/blob/master/assessment-2.md)) as well.

## Goals

This assessment focusses on the first main goal of this course: **improve your knowledge about core JavaScript concepts and apply the principle of Progressive Enhancement to your functionality**
