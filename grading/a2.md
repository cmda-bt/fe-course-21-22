## Assessment A2 - Team

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present your final prototype** with your **team**. First you'll present the whole project as a team to all the teachers. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project specifically for front-end. You've worked on optimizing the production environment of the application. For example, implementing a build or asset pipeline or optimizing modularity of the code by using preprocessors. Another example is optimizing for performance by minifying assets or compressing images.

_A teacher will try out your feature and look at the code._ You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assignment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals and topics of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for front-end. 

## Preperation

Since we have limited time make sure you come to the assessment prepared:

- **Bring your computer** and make sure it's _charged_ and connected to _Wifi_.
- Have the latest version of your feature **ready in your browser**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready on GitHub**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready in your editor**.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the assessment is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the assessment. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

      <td align="center">There is research about what production topic you've implemented in the team repo, you've documented your process and ideas and you've researched your topic. You've written about how you implemented your production topic.</td>
      <td align="center">The research is in-depth, you've technically described how you wrote your code and did research on alternativates</td>

      <td align="center">There is no cohesion in the front-end code of the application. All features are individually made and don't work together.</td>
      <td align="center">There was an attempt to unify the front-end in a single application, but it's buggy or not consistent.</td>
      <td align="center">Front-end architecture has been normalised among all team members. There are basic guidelines each team member follows. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are written using previous standard.</td>
      <td align="center">The application is really well integrated. There's a single strategy chosen and code is modular and applies only when needed.</td>
      <td align="center">This application has production-ready code. It works flawlessly and could have been made by a professional development agency. </td>

> **Note:**  
> _You'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_ you can't compensate between rows.  
> _Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.

### Guidelines

- We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee (examencommissie in Dutch).For more on plagiarism read our [_statement of academic integrity_](https://github.com/cmda-bt/fe-course-21-22/blob/main/docs/plagiarism.md).
- Grades will be published and communicated trough MS Teams and Brightspace. We also publish grade lists on Brightspace based on student numbers.
