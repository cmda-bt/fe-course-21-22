## Assessment A2 - Team

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present your final prototype** with your **team**. First you'll present the whole project as a team to all the teachers. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project specifically for front-end.

_A teacher will try out your feature and look at the code._ You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assignment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals and topics of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for front-end. 

## Preperation

Since we have limited time make sure you come to the assessment prepared:

- **Bring your computer** and make sure it's _charged_ and connected to _Wifi_.
- Have the latest version of your feature **ready in your browser**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready on GitHub**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready in your editor**.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the assessment is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the assessment. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

      <td align="center">All elements work together. Basic optimalisation has been applied. Class names, tags and general front-end architecture has been normalised among all team members</td>
      <td align="center">The application is really well integrated. There's a single CSS strategy (BEM?) chosen. JavaScript is modular and applies only when needed.</td>
      <td align="center">This application has production-ready code. It works flawlessly and could have been made a professional design studio.</td>

      <td align="center">The application doesn't work; there are errors and warnings</td>
      <td align="center">The applicaiton partially works but is not complete; incomplete flow</td>
      <td align="center">The application completely works and is usable from a user experience point of view</td>
      <td align="center">The application is advanced and is technically more complex</td>

      <td align="center">Your HTML, CSS and JavaScript display some form of semantic meaning, but are still all over the place</td>
      <td align="center">Your HTML is semantic and appropriate elements have been chosen. Your CSS is using some sort of structure and uses CSS variables. Your JavaScript is mostly consistent and structured</td>
      <td align="center">Your HTML, CSS and JavaScript display high levels of skill and learning. Other developers would love to build on your work</td>
      <td align="center">HTML, CSS and JavaScript are exemplary. You may have used preprocessors properly, worked modular and/or provide in-code documentation like a professional developer</td>

> **Note:**  
> _You'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_ you can't compensate between rows.  
> _Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.
